Resume 
----
    - arXiv 1801.01481
    - I could clean foreground with the ILC.
    - I tried to read Hamimeche 2008. I stopped at section II and will restart it when it is really needed. 
    - Today I resume the likelihood analysis.


To do 
----
    1. Copy the foreground cleaned maps. (Simulated WMAP full sky map)
    *socmb01:~/GroundBIRD/201804_IAC/lk/*
    2. Calculate power spectrum
    3. Evaluate covariance :math:`M_f` of angular power spectrum :math:`\hat{C}_l` for the fiducial model :math:`C_{fl}`.
    4. Test the value :math:`M_{f,(l,l+1)}/M_{f,(l,l)}`. The value in the paper is :math:`\sim 0.1`.
