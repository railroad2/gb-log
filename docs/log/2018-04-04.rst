In IAC
--------

    - Let me concentrate the CLASS paper.
    - Let's test ILC (Internal Linear Combination) 
    - I can get sense of map making.

CLASS paper 1801.01481
--------
    - :math:`\tau` estimation
    - a power spectrum-based likelihood to simultaneously clean foregrounds and estimate cosmological parameters in multipole space 
    - The universe was ionized by z=6, corresponding to a lower limit of :math:`\tau \gtrsim 0.038`. (Gunn & Peterson 1965)
    - :math:`\tau` can be constrained using :math:`C_l^{\text{TE}}` and :math:`C_l^{\text{EE}}`.

    - Cleaning foregrounds in 
        - Multipole space: ACTPol, BICEP2/Keck, Polarbear, SPTPol
        - Map space: Planck with smoothed map to :math:`\theta \sim 15^\circ`
    - E-B mixing - PRD 76, 043001 

    - Section 2: simulation data and assumptions
    - Section 3: implementation of the Hamimeche & Lewis pseudo :math:`C_l` likelihood and its efficacy at providing constraints given the simulated data
    - section 4: implications of a CLASS :math:`\tau` measurement in the context of external cosmological parameter constraints.

    2. Simulated maps
    
Planck destriping
--------
    - I will present the first result in Lab meeting, 
    - and will continue this after returning Korea.
