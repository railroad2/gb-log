Studying algorithm on A&A 127, 555-567 (1998)
^^
    - Now reading the paper 

    - 3.1 Readjusting the offsets of the circles
        - Adjusting the offsets of each circle, $A_i$
        - For PLANCK, each data circle crosses 3360 other such circles 
          in two spots for a 1 year mission.
        - By imposing that all the differences between signal over 
          the same sky pixels but observed with different rotation
          axis of the satellite at different times are minimised. (?)
        - One key requirement on the scanning strategy:
            any given circle do not cut all the other circles in just a small
            number of pixels, in which case the adjusted value for the offset
            of that circle would depend drastically on the realization of the
            noise on the pixels used for the adjustment. (why?)

        - procedure
            - A vector of spin-axis positions on the sky is generated.
            - For each such position, a vector of beam positions on a circle of
              radius 70 degree on the sky is generated.
            - As a result, two dimensional data set corresponding to these
              beam positions is generated. 
            - The actual inversion : Least mean square method

            .. math::
                S(A_i) = \sum_{p \in \text{sky}} \sum _{i_1 = 2} ^{n(p)} 
                         \sum_{i_2 = 1} ^{i_1 -1} w_{i_1, i_2} \times 
                         (\delta(i_1, i_2) - A_{i_1} + A_{i_2})^2

            where :math:`\delta(i_1, i_2)` is the estimated difference of offsets 
            obtained by comparing the measurements of circle :math:`i_2` and 
            circle :math:`i_1` on pixel :math:`p`, :math:`n(p)` is the number
            of times pixel :math:`p` is seen by the experiment, and :math:`w_{i_1,i_2}`
            is a weight attributed to measurement :math:`\delta(i_1, i_2)`.
