In IAC
--------

    - I have four days. 
    - Tue, Wed, Thu, and Fri
    - In Friday, I present the result for Quijote group.
    - I have three days practically.
    - To do's

        - Forecast

            - Make maps with r > 0. - Tuesday morning 

                - FFP9 (Full Focal Plane simulation # 9) 
                - What are the parameters?
                    
                    - Planck-2015 best fit cosmology.
                     
                - CAMB output has no unit
                    
                    - by multiplying Tcmb**2, it gets the unit 'K^2'.
                    - but it does not need in synfast...
                    - synfast and its anafast are not consistent with Mark's simulation

                        - the scale can be adjusted with beam smoothing.
                        - 10 < fwhm < 20

            - Toy map test of ILC   - Tuesday morning
                
                - Toy map will have non-zero r.
               
            - Applying ILC to Quijote and GB maps - Tuesday evening
            - Likelihood fit 

        - Map making

            - Make TOD in Quijote form - Tuesday afternoon
            - Test Quijote map making with my TOD

New cartegorization
---------
    
    Writing all things in daily log looks not the best way.
    I am trying to separate the notes by topics, and daily log will contain 
    daily plan and todo's and simple status.
