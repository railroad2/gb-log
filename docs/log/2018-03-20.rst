    How to simulate data.
        1. Generate 421 x 339 element table of Gaussian random number with rms 1.
            - Number of circles = 421 and number of samples on each = 339.
            - 14 month mission and 140 degree scan diameter. 
            - 1 circle per a day, 1 degree resolution

        2. Add offsets (:math:`A_i`) 
            - Various types of offsets can be considered.
                a) no offset (to test that the method does not make additional striping)
                b) a linear drift of :math:`100i/N_i`
                c) a sinusoidal drift of :math:`100 \sin (2\pi i / N_i)`
                d) a sequence of random offsets with an rms of 100
                e) a random walk of rms 10 per step
                f) e) without white noise (to check the intrinsic precision of the inversion)


    Questions
        Q1. Why is the weight :math:`2/(n(p)-1)` not :math:`2/n(p)/(n(p)-1)`?
            - One clue from the paper
                Note that the weight given to each term in the least-square sum 
                above is critical to reach this accuracy. For instance, if we put
                the same weight to each term, too much importance is give to points 
                on the circles that are close to the north and south ecliptic poles 
                (because they are "seen" by many more circles than the ones in the 
                ecliptic), and some residual striping of the order of magnitude
                of the white noise per pixel remains, because the value of the 
                offset recovered depends most on the realization of the white noise
                at points near the poles.
            - By this weight, total weight for a pixel is proportional to :math:`n(p)`
