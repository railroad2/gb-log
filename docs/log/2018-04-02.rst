In IAC

After lunch discussion with Ricardo 
    - Noise parameters
    - Three papers
        - on the optical depth analysis of WMAP and Planck 
        - on CLASS experiment
        - on foreground analysis 
    - I can try the foreground study and optical depth study 
    with simulated maps by Mark.
    - That's what I can try in this visitation.

    - What are the numbers, 310 uK*sqrt(s) and 530 uK*sqrt(s)?
        - Ricardo explained them but I didn't fully understand.
        - 1st priority 
    - Find 'r' from the simulated maps.
    - The downloaded data does not include GroundBIRD maps.

    Plan
        - in this week (March 27, 28, 29)
        - collecting modules 
        - modules and arguments 
        - class-wise modules
        - comments
        - upload on my github
