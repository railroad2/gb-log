Studying algorithm on A&A 127, 555-567 (1998)
--------

Plan

1. TOD simulation
    - with several algorithm
    - with several types of low frequency.
2. Generate map with Planck scan.
    - What is Planck scan?
        - Simplified one first.
        - 1 circle per day
        - 1 degree resolution
        - The spin axis oscillates sinusoidally with an amplitude of 15 degree and
        a frequency of 8 oscillates per year
    - generate Planck Nhit map.
    - Does it generate the stripes?
        - compare the cases with and without offsets.

3. Minimizing the least square function. 
    - To find the set of offsets for scanning circles.
    
1/f noise generation
--------

    How does the FFT scales?
        Is it affected by the sigma of white noise in time domain?
