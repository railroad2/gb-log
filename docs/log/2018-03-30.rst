GB readout update
--------

    - DDS_inst: dds_scaled
        - Two multipliers for I and Q
        - amps (phase_array) -> amps_in (dds_data) -> B for multiplier 
        - Timing constraint error occured at the end of a long implementation.

Studying algorithm on A&A 127, 555-567 (1998)
--------

    Planck map
        - map visualization - Pending
            - mollview
            - course of the pixel? - theta-phi mapping
            - course of the rotation axis - zenith for GB case

    Progress
        - Amat is almost singular.
        - How can the several measurements with one circle be treated?
            - Consider all degenerated cases - they are actually different measuremets.
        - After solving above bullet, it works. 
            - Sign is different. 
                - delta vector should be inverted. 
                - L.H.S. to R.H.S.

Reorganizing my gb-map codes
--------

    Plan
        - in this week (March 27, 28, 29)
        - collecting modules 
        - modules and arguments 
        - class-wise modules
        - comments
        - upload on my github
    
How to use cosmoMC?
