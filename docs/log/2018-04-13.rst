ILC
--------

    Is there a analytic solution to the ILC?

    - The problem
        
        For a given set of scales for foreground maps, can we analytically determine the coefficients to minimize the variance of the linear combination of the maps?
        Another constraint: sum of all coefficient should be 1.

    - This problem is very simplified problem which can be applied to a toy model. However, I think it is worth to test. 

    - Let's assume that the scales are given by a function or set of numbers :math: `F(\nu)`.
    
    - What we want to minimize is 

New cartegorization

    Writing all things in daily log looks not the best way.
    I am trying to separate the notes by topics, and daily log will contain 
    daily plan and todo's and simple status.
