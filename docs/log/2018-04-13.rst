ILC
--------
    - I calculated the variance of the three foreground-cleaned maps.
        
        1. WMAP original ILC map 
            var(m) = 0.005049375

        2. ILC with WMAP coefficients
            var(m) = 0.004950152

        3. My ILC coefficients 
            var(m) = 0.004948687

    - My ILC code did the best for given maps. (WMAP data)

    - Why the WMAP original ILC map is different from the reproduced map with WMAP coefficients?

        The map configurations can be different for these cases.

            1. Beam resolution

            2. Map resolution

New cartegorization
---------
    
    Writing all things in daily log looks not the best way.
    I am trying to separate the notes by topics, and daily log will contain 
    daily plan and todo's and simple status.
