Studying algorithm on A&A 127, 555-567 (1998)
--------

Planck hit map

    - Planck scan strategy (simplified version)
        1. One circle per day
            - 339 points on a circle
            - 140 degree width
        2. Rotation axis moves 
            - 1 degrees per day
            - On the celestial equator
        3. Rotation axis oscillates
            - sinusoidally
            - amplitude = 15 degree
            - frequency = 8 oscillations per year   

    - calculation strategy
        0. Define the observation direction vector
            - The coordinate is ecliptic coordinate
            - All rotational vectors are in ZYZ convention
        1. Rotate the vector by 70 degrees w.r.t. y-axis (elevation angle)
        2. Rotate the vector at 2*pi/86400 w.r.t. z-axis (Planck rotation)
        3-1. Rotate the vector by 90 degrees w.r.t. y-axis (on the equator)
        3-2. Rotate the vector by 90-sin(~~~ t) w.r.t. y-axis (oscillating spin axis)
        4. Rotate the vector by 1 degree/day w.r.t. z-axis (rotation of the earth around the sun)




1/f noise generation
--------

    How does the FFT scales?
        Is it affected by the sigma of white noise in time domain?

    .. code:: python 
        PSD = abs(numpy.fft.fft(d))**2/N/samplingrate

    why?
