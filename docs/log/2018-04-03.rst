In IAC
--------

    - Three papers
        - on the optical depth analysis of WMAP and Planck 
        - on CLASS experiment
        - on foreground analysis 

    - That's what I can try in this visitation.

    - What are the numbers, 310 uK*sqrt(s) and 530 uK*sqrt(s)?
        - Ricardo explained them but I didn't fully understand.
        - 1st priority 

    - Find 'r' from the simulated maps.
        - I used alm2cl for 'cmb_alm.fits' and r=0

    - I am going to join a Quijote meeting at 1 pm.
        - Quijote data -> TOD stacked w.r.t. azimuth angle. 
        - Some gaps in TOD and Map. Why?  
        - 1/f noise, Knee frequency

    - I discussed again with Ricardo and Alberto about
        - CLASS paper which explains ILC method for foreground separation
        - It will be my first work in IAC

    - I also get some sense about
        - Template fitting
        - Map making
        - Destriping
        - Sensitivity
        - ...    

GB readout update
--------

    - DDS_inst: dds_scaled
        - Timing constraint error occured at the end of a long implementation.

    - DDS_scaler_inst: DDS_scaler
        - Multiplier is included separately from DDS module.
        - Implementation is started at 16:30
        - Timing failure

Reorganizing my gb-map codes
--------

    Plan
        - in this week (March 27, 28, 29)
        - collecting modules 
        - modules and arguments 
        - class-wise modules
        - comments
        - upload on my github
    
How to use cosmoMC?
--------
    
    IDK.
