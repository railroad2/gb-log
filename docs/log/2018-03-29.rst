GB readout update
--------

    - Multipliers for amplitude adjustment are added to firmware.
        - In/Out data have 16 bit width.
    - Implementation was completed without any timing constraint errors. 
    - RBCP function for amplitude is added.
        - pinc_man - RBCP addr x"4100CCTB"
            - CC: Channel
            -  T: Type 0: phase inc., 1: phase offset, 2: amplitude scale
            -  B: byte number
        - amps : out phase_array
    - DDS_inst: dds_scaled
        - Two multipliers for I and Q
        - amps (phase_array) -> amps_in (dds_data) -> B for multiplier

Reorganizing my gb-map codes
--------

    Plan
        - in this week (March 27, 28, 29)
        - collecting modules 
        - modules and arguments 
        - class-wise modules
        - comments
        - upload on my github
    
    Progress
        - Planck_destrip class
        - initialized with following data 
            - map_measarr
                - map_measarr[Npix][n(p)]
                - contains measured values for circles on the given pixel
                - Npix = total number of pixel on the map
                - n(p) = number of measurements on the given pixel
            - map_ncirarr
                - map_ncirarr[Npix][n(p)]
                - contains the circle indices for measurements 
            - Ncircle
                - total number of circles
            - fsamples
                - number of sampling per circle
        - Calculation of coefficient matrix (Amat) and vector of combination of delta (dvec).
        - Inverse matrix (not yet)
